# Data-visualization

This project examines sales performed by various video 
games over the years. Various details of the video games are taken 
and used to determine what features of a game are most likely to 
succeed. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyse this data 
to make predictions on the success of video games and python is used 
to show the trends and details of both how sales occurred over the 
years and also visualize how our model predicts using various charts 
and graphs.
